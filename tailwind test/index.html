        <h1>Garlic bread with cheese: What the science tells us</h1>
        <p>
          For years parents have espoused the health benefits of eating garlic
          bread with cheese to their children, with the food earning such an
          iconic status in our culture that kids will often dress up as warm,
          cheesy loaf for Halloween.
        </p>
        <p>
          But a recent study shows that the celebrated appetizer may be linked
          to a series of rabies cases springing up around the country.

          Traditional thinking in the field of web design held that your website
          should be designed in a way to minimize the need for the user to
          scroll and to keep the most important information "above the fold."
          However, a lot has changed in recent years and if you think about it,
          we live in a scrolling culture. Web users have become accustomed to
          scrolling down pages to get that absolute last piece of information.
          Google also prefers websites that have longer session durations, and
          one of the ways to accomplish this is to entice visitors to scroll by
          creating unique experiences.
